# Data collection and analysis

## Definitions

* **Case:** A participant in a survey or experiment.
* **Variable:** A characteristic of a case.
* **Categorical variable:** A variable that divides cases into groups. Arithmetic operations do not make sense with categorical variables.
* **Quantitative variable:** A variable that measures numeric quantities. Arithmetic operations make sense with quantitative variables.
    * **Discrete quantitative variable:** A quantitative variable that can only take whole numbers.
    * **Continuous quantitative variable:** A quantitative variable that can take any real number.

## Question

Do education levels have an effect on believing in God?

* **Response variable:** The variable that we are trying to measure. In this case, it is believing in God.
* **Explanatory variable:** The variable that we think might influence the response variable. In this case, it is education level.

## Association and causality

* **Two variables are associated** if the values of one variable tend to be related to the values of the other variable.
* **Two variables are causally associated** if changing the value of the explanatory variable influences the value of the response variable.

## Confounding variables

* A **confounding variable** is a third variable that influences both the response variable and the explanatory variable. Confounding variables can cause a spurious correlation between the response variable and the explanatory variable.

## Methods of collecting data

* **Survey:** A survey is a study in which data is collected from a sample of people.
* **Census:** A census is a study in which data is collected from the entire population.
* **Observational study:** An observational study is a study in which researchers observe the values of variables without intervening to change the values of the variables.
* **Experiment:** An experiment is a study in which researchers actively manipulate the values of an explanatory variable to see how it affects the values of a response variable.

## Good criteria of an experiment

* **Randomization:** Randomization is the process of assigning subjects to groups randomly. This helps to ensure that the groups are similar and that any differences between the groups are due to chance.
* **Blocking:** Blocking is the process of grouping subjects together based on similar characteristics. This helps to reduce the variability within the groups and makes it easier to detect differences between the groups.
* **Replication:** Replication is the process of repeating the experiment multiple times. This helps to increase the accuracy of the results.
* **Blinding:** Blinding is the process of keeping the subjects and the researchers unaware of the treatment that the subjects are receiving. This helps to reduce bias in the results.

## Types of experiments

* **Completely randomized design (CRD):** In a CRD, subjects are randomly assigned to groups.
* **Randomized block design (RBD):** In an RBD, subjects are first divided into blocks based on similar characteristics. Then, subjects within each block are randomly assigned to groups.
* **Matched pairs design:** In a matched pairs design, subjects are matched based on their characteristics. Then, one subject from each pair is randomly assigned to each group.

## Two fundamental questions about data collection

* **What are the variables?** The variables are the characteristics of the cases that we are interested in measuring.
* **How were the data collected?** The data can be collected through surveys, experiments, or observational studies.
